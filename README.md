This repository is a collection of working examples of neural oscillators.

- Bursters
- Half-Centre oscillator (HCO)
- Simple oscillatory recurrent neural network with no intrinsic properties

Additionally, there are some examples of common oscillatory-related properties such as:
- spike-frequency adaptation (SFA)
- postinhibitory rebound (PIR)
- plateau potentials and bistability
